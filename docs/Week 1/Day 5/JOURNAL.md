## Phase 1 — Algorithmic Engineering (DSA)

### 1.1. Reverse Linked List (#206)
Implemented an iterative approach to reverse a singly linked list.

Traversed the list using a pointer while maintaining references to the previous, current, and next nodes.  
Updated the `next` pointer of each node to reverse the direction of the list.  
Returned the new head of the reversed linked list after completing the traversal.

### 1.2. Merge Two Sorted Lists (#21)
Implemented an iterative solution to merge two sorted singly linked lists.

Compared node values from both lists and appended the smaller node to the merged list.  
Advanced pointers accordingly while maintaining sorted order.  
After one list was exhausted, appended the remaining nodes from the other list to complete the merged result.
