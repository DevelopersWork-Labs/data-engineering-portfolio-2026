## 🛠️ Phase 1: Algorithmic Engineering (DSA)

### 1. Binary Search (LeetCode #704)
Implemented a binary search algorithm to locate a target value in a sorted array.

Initialized left and right pointers to define the search boundaries.  
Repeatedly calculated the middle index and compared the middle element with the target.  
Narrowed the search space by adjusting pointers based on comparison results.  
Returned the index of the target when found, or `-1` when the target was not present.

### 2. Search a 2D Matrix (LeetCode #74)
Implemented a binary search approach on a 2D matrix by treating it as a virtual 1D sorted array.

Calculated the effective search range using the total number of elements in the matrix.  
Mapped the computed mid index to 2D coordinates using row and column calculations.  
Applied binary search logic to locate the target value within the matrix.  
Returned a boolean result indicating whether the target exists in the matrix.
