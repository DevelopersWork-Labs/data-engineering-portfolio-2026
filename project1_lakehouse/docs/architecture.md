# Architecture

## Medallion Architecuture
    This is a data design pattern used for organising data into layers like bronze, silver, and gold. The goal is to incremently and progressively improve the structure and quality of the data at each layer
### Bronze Layer
    Raw data ingested from various sources
### Silver Layer
    Bronze data is cleaned and transformed into more structured and usable
### Gold Layer
    This is final layer with high quality of data. Data is refined and ready for business analytics and reporting
